## TODO-app

## Sara Viktorsson and Björn Tirsén

## Assignment 1, Backend 3, Webb20 - September 2021

### Tuesday September 28th - day 1:

We read the project requirements together and then put together a Trello board with the following columns: Requirements, Backlog, In Progress, Ready for Testing.

### Wednesday September 29th - day 2:

Yesterday we discussed the project and created cards on our trello board. We set up the project with dependencies, gitignore and ESLint, and created a repo on github. After that we created a database on Atlas, added a .env file with all database variables and made sure the connection was working. We created a model for a todolist and tried it with a post request from postman to see if the data was added to the database correctly.
